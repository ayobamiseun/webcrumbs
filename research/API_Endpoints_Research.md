Hello good people! If you're interested in helping WebCrumbs communicate seamlessly with WordPress, this task is for you. And don't worry if you're a beginner; you're more than welcome here!

## The Task

1. Research WordPress API: 
Just a quick skim to understand the basics of how WordPress sets up its API endpoints.

2. Draft a Markdown File: 
Summarize your findings and create a list of potential API endpoints that WebCrumbs could implement to align with WordPress. Your list can be simple, no need for any tech jargon.

3. Save it: 
Place your Markdown file in the /research directory in our GitHub repository.

That's it! By doing this, you're contributing valuable information that will help shape WebCrumbs' compatibility with WordPress. We're starting fresh, and every contribution counts.

Ready to take on the task? Here's your portal to the WebCrumbs GitHub repo. Go make history.

The Wordpress API enables developers to build incredible features on top of WordPress. It grants them the power to customize, extend, and interact with WordPress. This API has been used by renown companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google!

Wordpress API comes in two flavors, REST API and the XML-RPC API. The XML-RPC API is older and has limited functionality but is used for remote controlling Wordpress websites. The REST API is the modern and suggested one to use.

REST API allows you to use CRUD functionalities from the provider's server. It uses 5 types of http requests or routes: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE for respective CRUD operations. With these requests there are unlimited ways to manipulate data from Wordpress. 

Requests can to sent to the REST endpoints for content and the API will respond back with data in JSON format.

Extensibility is allowed for the Wordpress API.
