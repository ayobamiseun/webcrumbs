## Chatbot creation tool

**Description**: 
A plugin that lets you create a custom chatbot for online support. The chatbot can be configured to answer users' frequently asked questions, direct visitors to specific site pages or even collect useful information for support teams.

**Justification**: 
Chatbots have become essential tools for improving the customer experience on websites. They offer instant assistance, are available 24/7 and can handle a high volume of requests without human intervention. This reduces the support team's workload, improves user satisfaction and increases operational efficiency. A chatbot creation tool within WebCrumbs would make it much easier for website owners to implement this powerful technology, without requiring advanced development skills.
